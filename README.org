#+TITLE: Prhyme Rhyme Generation

Utilities for rhyming, NLP corpus text cleaning, syllabification, markov modeling, etc...

This repo is a bit of a scratch-pad. As utilities solidify, I've been extracting them out.

- https://github.com/eihli/phonetics
- https://github.com/eihli/darklimericks

Some cool things that haven't been extracted yet and remain in an alpha state:

- Part-of-speech tagging/processing using OpenNLP https://github.com/eihli/prhyme/blob/main/src/com/owoga/prhyme/nlp/core.clj
- Simple Good-Turing frequency estimation https://github.com/eihli/prhyme/blob/main/src/com/owoga/prhyme/generation/simple_good_turing.clj
