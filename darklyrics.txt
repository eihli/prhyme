 I close my eyes, and let the demons in To clear my mind from the things that I have seen On my knees, Father - please leave the crowd And let me out I lost my way so many times before That I forgot just what I'm living for I'm in the dark, light's so hard to find... So now I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin My angry tears like raindrops in the dust I realized there's no one you can trust Shot in the back sinking in the night That's how I'm leaving it all behind - I'm changing skin I told you once, I told you twice That you can't live on compromise - but you won't listen Another time, another place It's like a neverending race and there's no reason To waste your life away in one single day Bridges are burning and chances are few Man with the scythe - he is coming for you Stage is the same but some faces are new Why can't you see that it's over? I pulled you up, you let me down I'm sick of dragging you around - it feels like forever I'm going left, you're going right Out of my life, out of my sight - it's now or never Go waste your life away in one single day Bridges are burning and chances are few Man with the scythe - he is pointing at you Stage is the same but some faces are new Why can't you see that it's over? Bridges are burning and chances are few Listen, I'm trying to tell you that Time's running out, God, but we never knew Night's getting cold and your story is old - it's been told I let you in, I turned you loose I gave you lot's of time to choose to change the story You are the snake around my hand The one who used to be my friend - and now you're sorry I've suffered all the way - you will today Go, waste your life away in one single day Bridges are burning and chances are few Man with the scythe - he is coming for you Stage is the same but some faces are new Why can't you see that it's over? Bridges are burning and chances are few Waiting is over and this is your cue Time's running out, God, but you never knew Listen, I'm trying to tell you The echo of "goodbye" got poisoned by the lie: "I'll never let you go" The shadow of your smile is gone, I wonder why But now I'll never know Let the river flow to the place where sorrow grows No, I just can't let you go! 1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry 1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by You're 1000 miles away Another day, another place, another scar across my face At least it's something new You've disappeared - I'm left behind, about to lose my mind I had my faith in you Let the river flow to the place which I will never know No, I just can't let you go 1000 miles away - can you hear me calling when I see you cry 1000 miles away - wasted days are passing by 1000 miles away - while the sun is shining river's running dry 1000 miles away - I never cared to say goodbye You can break my heart, you can rape my soul Tear my life apart, push me until I'll fall Step by step, day by day, now it's time to break away Never look back - while you can hear my call Never look back - until the final curtain'll fall Never look back - now you can leave it all Never look back - just leave and never come back You can tell me lies, you can waste my "bread" Only in my eyes you're as good a dead Tear by tear, laugh by laugh, now I think I've had enough How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you're leaving If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing If I could pray this pain away... You're in my arms - if I could wish you back You're in my arms - my world is turning black You're in my arms - just let me take your pain You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I could follow And make you stay just one more day I'm going down, someone please help me Out of this world - nobody hears me I close my eyes praying for you But nobody cares even when I do Scream my head off and cry my wounded heart out Who gives a damn about one voice in the crown I'll give everything, even those very few Days of my life which I have left - to you I'm walking the streets of blooming despair and regret Kid in the alley is pressing the gun to his head Is he right, is he wrong, is he weak, is he strong Was he fighting alone - on his own? Rain's falling down and I pray - take all his pain and his sorrow I wish he could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow Rain's falling down and I pray - show my the way and I'll follow Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow I'm closing the door to the room full of sorrow and rage Girl in the window in tears sliding over the edge Is she right, is she wrong, is she weak, is she strong Was she fighting alone - on her own? Rain's falling down and I pray - take all her pain and her sorrow I wish she could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow Take my and fly my away on the wings of tomorrow Am I right, am I wrong, am I weak, am I strong Am I fighting alone - on my own? Rain's falling down and I pray - take all my pain and my sorrow I wish I could leave it today under the wings of tomorrow Rain's falling down and I pray - show me the way and I'll follow Take me and fly me away on the wings of tomorrow I've been up, I've been down Bigger stuff couln't kick me around So you can drop your illusions and hopes About making me cold I've been low, I've been high Tell me, while I was learning to fly Were you feeding your bitch with the gold paid For your friends whom you sold? Can't you understand? I watch your bridges burning Snake around my hand just bit again I'm your smile and I'm your tear I'm your pleasure, I'm your fear When you're down on the floor I'm your master, I'm your slave I'm the one who you've betrayed Nothing is real and it never will be like before I'm your freedom, I'm your drug I'm your shadow in the dark Nowhere to hide or to run anymore I'm your shame and I'm your pride Now I'm leaving you behind Waiting for my pain to knock on your door You can roll, you can crowl I think Biff's kind of said it all "You're getting rid of the deadly desease By cutting it right out" I guess you make your point Selling friends for the shiny coin You can cheat, you can lie - can you die And make your maker proud? How can I tell what's on my mind right now, while you'releaving If I could catch you final breath and never stop believing If I could pray this pain away... You're in my arms - if I could wish you back You're in my arms - my world is turning black You're in my arms - just let me take your pain You're in my arms - I'm crying out your name I saw that fear behind your stare, that hope to see tomorrow It breaks my heart 'cos now you're gone - I wish that I couldfollow And make you stay just one more day A black cat moans When he's burning with the fever A stray dog howls When he's lonely in the night A woman goes crazy With the thought of retribution But a man starts weeping Whe he's sick and tired of life I keep on dreaming dreams of tomorrow Feel I'm wasting my time Lighting candles in the wind Always taking my chances On the promise of the future But a heart full of sorrow Paints a lonely tapestry The sun is shining But it's raining in my heart No one understands the heartache No one feels the pain 'Cos no one ever sees the tears When you're crying in the rain I can never deny All the sweet things I have tasted Tho' I've been mistreated I keep coming back for more I know where I'm going There's no hope of absolution I can't seem to separate The good times from the bad Lineup: Kenny Luebcke - lead and backing vocals Henrik Brockmann - backing vocals Andre Andersen - keyboards, bass, acoustic and electric guitars Bjarke Hopen - guitar Jacob Kjaer - guitar Mark Guanaa - guitar Kaj Laege - drums Allan Sorensen - drums Kenneth Olsen - drums  I'm heading back from years of repressing the thought How was I wrong pretending to be who I'm not Feels like being alone too long, Chasing dreams on my own - I'm coming home This time around it's perfectly clear in my mind Along the way -I know what to lose, what to find Being stranded and lost too long, Now I'm moving along - I'm coming home Can't figure out the stuff you're telling me. Whatever, I don't care Is it another way of showing me what hides behind your stare? Whatever drives you -I don't wanna know, I saw it all before I'm moving up and leaving you below, so keep your stupid war No one remembers when it's all begun, but I won't rack my brain To understand why every bit of fun you're turning into pain - I don't know. No matter what you want - I'm checking out, ain't coming back again I wish you luck - without me around, I got a better plan Tell me why can't I settle for less, Tell me why am I running ahead of the rest Tell me why all this hell of a mess, Tell me why can't I settle for a little bit less? Cold. The night is crawling, surrounding every corner of our lives Wait - somebody's waiting for you to close your eyes... Sleep. Whole world's asleep. I hear the darkness rising from the deep Deep, a lake so deep, reflecting every star you've ever seen. Time flies. Better open up your eyes - you're living in the desperate times Pain. I'm used to pain, it leads me through the neverending rain Rain, that heartless rain won't wash my sins and helpless tears away But I know - now it's time to hold the line 'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief Countless miles through the lies A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate times, Those lonely times Gone. Forever gone my sense of time, I've lost it on the run Run, I've always run from everything I've seen an' done But now... Now it's time to draw the line, time to hold the line 'Coz I'll live, yes I'll live I'll cross the sea of madness on the wave of disbelief Countless miles through the lies A wind of change will take me far away from our desperate days Faceless days, lonely days Keep pushing me around and leaving scars across my face In my eyes our live's a neverending struggle to escape From our desperate times. Years of rejections and years of regrets, years of unbearable guilt, Years of creating a dream life could never fulfill Days of forgiveness and days of no trust toss me around like a toy Days which will make me forget even seconds of joy While pain is cutting like a knife I'm trying hard to reinvent My life - all my life Left in a cell with a window so small - barely feeling the sun Sneaking the light on my skin. But my struggle's begun. Pushing aside every shadow of fear, lifting myself from the ground, Throwing the glove in the face of what's holding me down While pain is working with it's knife I'm trying hard to reinvent The rest - the bits and pieces of my life. Sorrow, you are my friend on a day like this I hope tomorrow will never come to see my tears I feel the heat's getting closer to me Shadows are getting darker in my hands The sun Is fighting to find a brighter shade of gray, But I'm a man with a mission tonight I'm painting black on black all over the world All my future, all your past I'm fighting colors with a brush as my sword Through every single day until my last I'm changing seasons to the state of my soul - Now you see them, now they're gone I'm painting black on black all over the world Znd I won't stop until my work is done. Wall of fear surrounds you every night, while you're asleep Pain within won't let you go, won't let you take a deep breath It's everything - a shelter in your heart, Last resort of sanity before it falls apart Leave all your fears, let them rule on the island of tears Who'll make you stay if you feel like today is the day To sail away Rise above your nightmare. You've been down, now make it pay Step on every piece and let It bleed - now turn away. Everyday, all night long I keep on wondering 'bout what went wrong Was I blessed, was I cursed? It doesn't matter, but what made it burst? Whatever put me down - It hit me hard, you know, so hard It took my breath away and now it broke my heart Tell me what turns you on, what makes you drill my every single bone? Now you win, an' I lost. I waste my time around this evil ghost Whatever gets you high - it's tearing me apart so hard But I don't wanna know what made you break my heart Now I'm turning away. In die end of the day As I'm looking behind, pass the enemy line While the smoke disappears - you're alone with your tears, And a new day's begun, but there's nowhere to run All your fences are up as they were from the start, So while I'm moving away, there's only one thing to say: Doesn't matter who's fault - if you're still standing tall Or you're falling apart - you can keep a little piece of my heart.  A brand new day at last is born The first wave breaks on the shore The sun's shining bright Across the centuries of pain My heart is rising again Did you hear all my cries? I'm on the edge to turn away I can't explain But I don't want to be alone It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere I'd like to know how to carry on... I ask myself in the end: _Was everybody just lying Right from the start? And if you're longing to be free You better think of a way To find some love in your heart I'm on the edge to turn away I can't explain But I don't want to be alone It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere And now I know how to carry on! I'm falling with the rain I'll meet you once again, Set me free! I'm flying to ever more But I won't fly alone Can't you feel me letting go? A moment like a million more, Let me hold it for a while! Just strangers now or have we met before? I's up to you to treat me well Or throw me on the floor There's a reason why we live and die In the end only our footprints stay behind... There's a time for love,a time for pain Have you seen how pictures melt down With the sky? Letting go,letting go... Sometimes the Universe Fits inside my world There's nowhere else to be And no place to return The power in my hands Let law be made by force At times my conscience speaks But now it's more and more The day I'm waiting for... ...Is in the air I breathe Fine and strong and pure, Out in the sea beneath, The mountains and the shore Inside this picture A city made by God Irrational progress But now it's more and more Today the skies are blue I hold the sun tight in my arms... Rio,falling apart Someday I will die for you Never,never give it up One day I will die for you In your arms! I see my universe Grow larger than before Maybe it's just because Nobody cared to shut the door! I'm locked inside your arms, The key is in my soul There is no true scape So here's where I belong I look around and see A city made by God I used to be free But now I am no more! Together we are strong Let's make the future Built on dreams!! Rio falling apart (...) To play with desire Is playing with fire Right from the start! I see the future coming I'll tell you what's to be A life turns into another But no more I can't see And I hold your hand You said you'd never leave him But now you let him go Someday he will forgive you And stop to suffer so A storm arrives with thunders The end arrived with smiles A life inside another Has made its ways through cries And I hold your hand Yes, I hold your hand... Some days we're covered up in sorrow But still we're standing here Sometimes this life's too short to understand Someone, oh, please just let me borrow A little courage for my fears at night... Don't drift into a state of sadness Making something never seen Look under every stone along the way Whatever happens, use your power, Don't surrender to your fears at night... So, turn around, Keep on moving now Hitting every single road Just keeping on running on and on and on... Running on and on we face our fears I remember why And though the dangers run so near, A rainbow fills the sky The freedom lies over our heads We must live before we die Believe me, I remember why! There's a way To melt down your frozen heart Just keep on living Cause inside, your will Never dies! Oh, no! I'm just trying to find me I'm just trying to find me You said I'm too proud to regret it You never saw how hard it was for me To take control of my own emotions To find a way to set myself free So am I fine to play the role Of someone long forgotten soul But what is obvious is that you're so trapped Inside your own world Some days I wonder if I could Be another kind of person,find another truth I know these words all too well: By yourself no one else,never break the spell! How long? How long will we hide what's going on? How long will we stand alone? To see Whatever lays inside of you and me It just needs to be unleashed away! I said now I want to forget it So many tears have rolled down in vain And in the end it's just the same 'Cos I know it will never change I think I never satisfied you Did you find it somewhere else? No regrets,just keep on moving You better trust yourself! Someday I wonder if I could (...) I'm just trying to find me... I'm just trying to find me... I thought you'd last forever But like a star,you never would A stairway on the rainbow I wish that I knew Your silhouette surrounds me I miss the way things used to be Your voice floats in the wind How I wish you were here... Solitude is taking over! By the way, So many things I kept from you till now Stand by me, Reach out for my hand and I will follow! Beyond this time I'm living now, I'm ever looking back at you And when it rains upon the green fields, I'll be thinking about you.. Remember how it feels now You taught me freedom with few words The beauty of this world was All pointed by you Solitude is taking over! By the way, So many things I kept from you till now Stand by me, Reach out for my hand and I will follow! Beyond this time I'm leaving now I'm ever looking back at you And when it rains upon the green fields, I'll be thinking about you... Beyond this time (...) I knew one day you had to leave me Still I'll walk on with you... I decided to come here To tell you what I never could! In the end we're not the same, I'm tired of being misunderstood All I need is to break free Like my spirit used to be Too many nights I thought of you But now there's nothing I can do... Forgive me but I'll say the truth: It's time to face the end! What goes around Comes around back to you, Forgive me but I'll say the truth... See the scars deep in your face, Feel the thorns around your heart All that's gone now stays behind, There's no need to fall apart All I want is to run free With no shadows over me So far away Though standing near I know these words are hard to hear! Forgive me but I'll say the truth: It's time to free the end! What goes around Comes around straight to you, Forgive me but I'll say the truth... Would you pledge absolution to me now? Will you throw away your armour? Or will it go on and on with you? Forgive me but I'll say the truth... Forgive me but I'll say it There's nothing left to stop me Forgive me but I'm over you! Falling drops against the window I took a while to feel awake Moving clouds is this dream never end Memories haunt me again Hear a voice It sounds like water Visions make me slip away All around,the forest growls While the whispers fill my head Falling down into a stream of ages Visions make me slip away That every day, I realized the fire burning Out,as far as I could see I feel into a silent morning It's hard to tell,but I say: Whatever it was,it makes me fear Invisible for the rest But I recall it all so clear These times of joy,these times of wonder Like a lost edge inside our dreams It makes me wonder: What is life,what does it mean? Rise again, For your fate will always follow you No more cries,no hurt and pain See the future like never before Undress your sorrow Leave the past all behind Time to be free! Falling drops against the window I took a while to feel awake Moving clouds is this dream never ends... Sounds,they pierce through like an arrow Hear my voice,it beats like rain Memories,I'll carry them away... These times of joy,these time of wonder (...) Time to be free,give me time to be free... I need some time to be free What if you could unlock your dreams? Could you perceive what they mean? The nights are clear,the days so dark But there's a way out there... Whatever comes into your mind May be the answers trapped inside You feel a cold cut through your veins But there's a way out there... Alone you go into the darkness You feel the fear of someone else A broken picture from the past The feeling traces in your hands But there's a way out there... Alone you go into the darkness What you're searching for... Struggling for your sanity Is knocking at your door... Dream inside reality! The more you will find, The less you will get... Last tears never cried Will drown you in the end You've got nowhere to hide You've got nothing to give Who'll rescue now you will to live? Along your life you never felt on inch of pain Because you never realized you're still the same! You ask me why but I'm afraid to let you know I was your pride that made you fall so far below... What you're searching for (...) "The more I could find The less I could get Tears never cried Drowned me in the end I spread nothing but lies I had no love to give Who'll rescue my will to live?" Life storm broke my anchors And like a wreek I've been Sea and sky were just one darkness Such a brilliant radiance...You came! I'm alive,I'm alive... Just by the light from your eyes! Life storm freed my anchors Many shores,I've seen Sea and sky,they gave me shelter Now we only meet in dreams I'm alive,I'm alive... Just by the light from your eyes! And I need you to be Like the haven that I seek But clouds showed me and I saw! You were just the moonlight... And the moon belong...To no one! Suddenly,I stare and see The light in you still shines on me Pouring down,endlessly... The aftermath of disaster Strikes down to the earth Time is life's destroyer A transitional mixing Commercing us all As we split forever in two And the wheels keep turning... Suspended in time As you glide through the air See your body below you Feelings no longer hurt, No more fears within Let me fly together with you And the wheels keep turning... Stand forever in the rain Watch the sun Break through the sky If this world has let you down Take a leap to higher ground Cause your heart will never die! Conscience wakes to remind you The rule of the game There's no turning back now You'll became someone else You perceptions will change Let me change forever with you And the wheels keep turning... Stand forever in the rain (...) These nights of thunder Won't come back Just disappeared These nights of thunder,so dark Mode visions become clear! Endeavour always Leads so far Beyond the scene Endeavour always sows love... The struggle ends up here! Here we stand Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two Sleepless nights Losing ground I'm reaching for you, you, you Feelin' that it's gone Can change your mind If we can't go on To survive the tide love divides Someday love will find you Break those chains that bind you One night will remind you How we touched And went our separate ways If he ever hurts you True love won't desert you You know I still love you Though we touched And went our separate ways Troubled times Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain Distant eyes Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain If you must go, I wish you love You'll never walk alone Take care my love Miss you love I still love you girl I really love you girl And if he ever hurts you True love won't desert you No, No  Inspiration Introspection Keep on drilling round and round. Incarnations Circumspection Sending shockwaves through the ground The power got so close to me Changing my dreams and my hopes Time to remember the tide will return Bringing together a storm! Let it come out and I'm leading on Just for a while and the stars will burn! Let it come out and I'm leading on just for one night and the skies will burn Oh they'll burn! Tonight, it descends a new reason That thunders inside us intensely Under the moonlight. It's reaching out And you'll see: You're making a final decision Evoking the might and the fury Drowning together back to Earth's womb... The power got so close to me Changing my dreams and my hopes. Time to remember the tide will return Bringing together a storm! Let it come out and I'm leading on Just for a while and the stars will burn Let it come out and I'm leading on Just for one night and the skies will burn oh they'll burn! And If I tell you that our hearts are free again You'll know I will return When you hide yourself away You know you're pretending When you shed your feelings When you let then down Many times in life we stray We're seeking an exit The solitude is leading to a final call Will you hide in the sea? Will you lay all your sorrow on me? And if I tell you that our minds are free again You'll know I will return So many stars are lightning up along the way You'll know I will return Back forever I remember the first time I dream to be over I believed in demons, I believed in saints Now we see what we became The dream was forever Since we know the path we won't miss match again I will rise from the sea I will take you forever in me And If I tell you that our hearts are free again You'll know I will return So many stars are born each in everyday You know I will return Back forevermore The dream was forever We won't miss match again I will rise from the sea I will take you forever in me And If I tell you that our hearts are free again You'll know I will return So many stars are born each in everyday You know I will return Back forevermore Staring at the audience Your head is a cage Broken thought fly over A familiar stage Gathering the pieces of yourself That you can't live without It's only when you became someone else That you can ease your mind Always Heart full of rancour Has made yourself blue Enlightened by darkness The fear becomes true Kept always pretending That nothing's been done If your burn with fire With fire you'll get burnt! Gathering the pieces of yourself That you can't live without It's only when you become someone else That you can ease your mind Always playing a role! The action was so brilliant The audience applauds! You bend down your head and Deflect any flaws Inside your heart's freezing Your mind is a cell You've swallowed the fire And fire was your spell Gathering the pieces of yourself That you can't live without It's only when you become someone else That you can ease your mind Always playing a role! Ran away, In a fragment of despair From a vicious threat Such a damage to repair Finding the truth Where all have already searched Is the only way To fulfill a soul with lust Lust for revenge In a world full of sins Something we're building now Never figured in dreams Banal intentions Mold a personality needles to mention Madness and insanity Lust for a chance In a world full of wins What are we searching now That belong to our dreams? Shift the night away Shift the night away Nothing else could let us fall We're building up our hopes We're trusting them again And suddenly a sign will be found Shift the night away Shift the night away Nothing else could let us fall We're building up our hopes We're trusting them again And suddenly a sign will be found Make a stand Start all over In your inner core Some day what has caused your suffering Will reset you back for more Shift the night away Shift the night away Nothing else could let us fall We're building up our hopes We're trusting them again And suddenly a sign will be found and suddenly a light has been found!

All over now Watch overhead Nothing left but Some open wounds That won't heal away Till you can see all the truth All over now Till one day Life smiles back... To you! Transforming what's invisible To controvert the physical A blinding ray across the dark In outerspace A veils of sparks The surging particles align Quantum reaction in the night Converting matter into light Hear an S.O.S Drawn inside the torrent Fear contains a quest Now the unbearable unveils Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain Primal forces spin around Magnitude reveals a plan Anything leads to the edge Have you ever tried? Nothing but a state of mind Just mentalize Just mentalize A magic echoes everyday keeps emanating from the brain Converting matter into light The will prevails over the time Send an S.O.S Drawn inside the torrent faith contains a quest The unbearable unveils Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain Primal forces spin around Magnitude reveals a plan Anything leads to the edge Have you ever tried? Nothing but a state of mind Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain Primal forces spin around Anything leads to the edge Have you ever tried? Drawing near Mentalize! Among the myriad of green another grief has been heard today it flew tearing out again all the way through the landscapes of light 'till the dawning is killing the night And how much time will be left to paint the blue on the firmament and nothing will be changed nothing else will resist without care and the last regret harder to bear Who said you're invincible is not at your side now, not at your side now somedays we're invisible, no one can see us out in the myriad your prayers cannot prevent what's meant to be broken, it's gotta be broken it's not just a miracle consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad... You made your way to the light and now no reason retrocede but once it starts to burn feels so useless to capture the fire, oh oh and nature is ready for war! awake again it's all inside of you this feeling has to stand the coldest winds that freeze and bind you you're about to see the true face of nature the selfish won't be spared succumb in the end that's all they search for! Who said you're invincible is not at your side now, not at your side now somedays we're invisible, no one can see us out in the myriad your prayers cannot prevent what's meant to be broken, it's gotta be broken it's not just a miracle consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad... It was a day when the sun cried out it was a moment to burden the doubt whatever lingers will never reveal whatever leftover wishes conceal and it's clear Like the rain:all my fears define who I am and I hear loud and long, everywhere, a mythical song Hung in the sky, a lonely star caught in the twitlight it dances apart stuck at the gates where the dead stepped in a subtle hollow spreads out from within and I see All the way what my eyes could never convey and it's near,closer now everywhere,a mystical sound Oh... let me know don't fly away, I'm here I need to know when will the rain pour down again coming down over us,washing the past with a smile To the top of the hill reach out the sky awake from the dream now I know we'll fly away we're free here we go the falling rain will come again no matter where or when it will pour down in the end. I never thought I feel a whim slipping through my hands the morning light comes breaking in as the blackness fades No bad reflections can resist the beginning of an age a sentence for a crownless king whose kingdom was a cage Wonder again why why should we miss the burning of the flame wait for another sign of rising disorder till the blade relieves the pain Inside your eyes I see a mirror you mesmerize and there's no error myself in you to be continued Inside your eyes I see a mirror of me! I kept a token of my pleas carved them into stone but after sailing open seas two became one Wonder again why why should we cease the spreading of the stain wait for another sign of rising disorder till the light 'cause again Inside your eyes I see a mirror you mesmerize and there's no error myself in you to be continued Inside your eyes I see a mirror of me! Inside a nest we were born there we grew up together you flew away towards the sun I rather stayed and wondered why do we fear the storm? why do we hate and suffer? inside the heart the mystery lives on inside the mind,it succumbs! so, anywhere you go flowing with the stream have a look inside and see who in fact we are what you've done so far with the time you let go Violence and decadence tragic routes that cross each other no one cures the consequence left behind by violence Learn from your lessons my friend and your heart will beat much stronger for a man who looks out just dreams but he who looks in awakens! So, anywhere you go flowing with the stream stuck within the realms of flesh all we see is flesh longing for the next episode of pain cause Violence and decadence tragic routes that cross each other no one cures the consequence left behind by violence I've never been The ordinary man The world begin Like every story does my friend I won't come down To where i was back then And nice mirage of love Has matter single in my heart, my friend But when the white fog descends Over the meadows of light And when the milking way descends And shatters the meadows of light It's time to stand up, stand up and walk Walk all alone, down the same road I could feel again Cause i long for the answers lost And I'd change everything If i could have a lapse in time And i could feel again Before going insane for good I would change all mistakes of mine With just a lapse in time Do you remember, not too long ago the cherry tree blossomed in vain? it was so hazy, yet hard to forget now all seems to happen again With the power of your mind no desire is denied It's a power stream you conceive your dreams in world you'd never say no there's a place to go land of miracles where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no Time is scare now,you better sleep forget all the crosses beared and though you keep on dreaming,your life is for real all you need to do now is dare With the power of your mind every longing can be defined... It's a power stream you conceive your dreams in world you'd never say no there's a place to go land of miracles where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no Before the rays of light Into a fading bright Riled up by such a thrill again I just keep still, don't move The reason can't improve A scene unfolding in my mind Into the light I'm falling Nobody turns to hear cries Climbing the highest peak of pain A reason to stay? Can't stand the pressure of The pleasures that I bought They promised I'd be free someday!! They told me: "Don't despair" But then now who'd expect A phantom shadowing my nights Into the nightmare, running Somebody, please, set me right Offer some kindness, no domain A reason to stay Oh, waiting for the sun No wonder why our lives Were waiting just to run Don't need you by my side to hang together on the ropes Won't you get out of the way? I've got to go! Before the coming fight You need to stay alive Riled up by such a thrill again! Into the nightmare, running Somebody, please, set me right Offer some kindness, no domain A reason to stay Oh, just waiting for the sun No wonder why our lives Were waiting just to run Don't need you by my side to tell me it's alright, no more... Won't you get out of the way? Oh, waiting for the sun... From this day on, I'm freed forevermore Don't need you by my side to hang together on the ropes Come on, get out of the way I've got to go!!!  Story of life Story of fate Something I could've done and now I feel I've lost myself in time A picture of those Beyond control Hearts messed up, abide, And so I hear Spirits weep out loud Living for my next step Swinging across the border line I wanna climb those stairs And reach the top now You brought me what I need Addictive heroin You sucked my heart, still you want everything Melting flesh and bone I don't know what you are I don't know where I've been Just look behind and see the shadow Of a one-day-promisse Come for a ride In the kingdom of light Most of us don't care to sign the deal When evil hangs around Heading for my last step Running across the border line I wanna stand and stare... You brought me what I need Addictive heroin You sucked my heart, still you want everything Melting flesh and bone Whole days and nights in vain Unplug and mute the pain These matted eyes now miss the last glare Of a one-day-promisse Northern lights dance in the air Nature paints its scenes Haunting the winter sky The wild is so vast, The air quiet and still Today a new sun will rise We’ll be together when the time comes around We’ll save our prayers and never say farewell Far becomes close; Scary, divine A sudden blaze reveals the course of life I walk in the night Counting the stars, in silence With tears in my eyes But I’ll never surrender We’ll be together when the time comes around We’ll save our prayers and never say farewell Nothing to fear, Nowhere to hide Nobody escapes the course of life As the universe expands And high flames are burning As the light breaks through the haze And sunrays melt away the snow The streams get out of control For we don't own life It's a fact: we're born to stray On this deadly journey We don' know where it begins And nobody tells where it goes The wheels just roll down the road Is there still a chance? We're alive - that's all we can say We must stay alert through the night Side by side, let's keep hand in hand And wait for the turn of the lights... The turn of the lights! Someday I Will feel enough To remember What’s gone And I will live enough To be humming This song Someday I will Rejoin your soul When fire stars Are falling down on me Let the clouds And let the rain Pour red tears down Today Let the heart And let the pain Flow away Away Feel what is over Feel what is dead Your smile forever will live Like a scar So many say It will never fade away Like a rainbow in the darkest sky Someday I will be Together with you Someday I will leave This woe behind For good Like a scar So many say It will never fade away Like a rainbow in the darkest sky Someday I will be Together with you Someday I will leave This woe behind For good You declare wars in your head You desert them all instead Every pulse that pumps your veins Just reminds you of the weight All over you... Simply for a little joy You neglect and then destroy The key questions in your mind When your self-esteem is low When you find nowhere to go Stop!... the world can't wait! You won't find a crystal ball Throughout the haze It's about time To quit that maze Nothing justifies your pain For there's no one else to blame When a shade follows my footsteps at night That could be you I descend to the riverside As I’m staring at the blackened water flow I sense you getting close I know you’re getting close I could reach my hand And fool my heart one more time I could stick to what remains… It’s helpless: our future is behind us! - You say that you go, you don’t go And you never leave a choice - You say that you need, you don’t need Though there’s urgency in your voice You’ve been searching for happiness But emptiness you’ve found You say that you go You think you belong - no, you don’t You’re still living on your own Is there a future for me? Is there a hope? Sometimes illusions, they drown And dreams are gone with the flood In the start, light had been made There were rainbows in the air In a place we all belong It’s so curious how it swaps Like the pieces of a play It depends on how we stand Day after day How we care for each word we say, Each move we make… You pretend you’re in control That you sit so high above But I prevail without you When at night you call my name All your tears roll down in vain You’re nor unreplaceable We must stand Day after day We must care for each word we say, Each move we make… The corporations' jaws Are spreading all around Invading like a plague, you can't ignore You're led into a trap They even seem to care About your life, your health - your misery! They need you to stay They want you to play They will find the way into your needs You're scanned high and low Cause they want to know: - Are you plain enough to serve us? Every time they reach their goals You're stabbed, but you don't know Can't you sense the Oversoul? The meaning of it all... The blooming of a life You're innocent and wild You guess you know the truth but you just don't That's right when it begins: You've gotta join that game! You're looking for respect - to be someone! They force you to play They lead you to crave From now on they'll be behind your needs You'll do what they say Can't choose your own way Right when it's too late to turn back Every time they reach their goals You're stabbed, but you don't know Can't you sense the Oversoul? The spirit of it all... Look around and see: Have you lost all will to live? Why don't you stand and fight for your soul? The sight revealed before my eyes On that very day A sea of clouds surrounding high The mountain summit All so unexpected, Falling to pieces to the ground At first I held the shock inside And then I woke up I looked around and realized: The white was red with blood All so disconnected When you're striving to survive I must go... Over the top, to the summit Or never know What lies behind the white giant of snow Step by step to the summit I'm face to face with the giant There's no return... Unleash the beast you used to be Let go off, and set it free Relieve your heart, let it breathe Forget the place you used to know Get ready for a miracle Straightening the curve of the road From this time, from this day You'll never be the same Leave behind what's insane And let it fade away You can still count on me From the past, nothing remains It's light-years away When you just listen to the words From someone who wants to take hold Of your will, of your thoughts, Of your mind and soul People who've lost their own life Normally try to get by Inside your world, to lead you on, They cherish when you fall... Sometimes I'm sad and lonely Somedays because I miss you You held me tight in your arms As I came out of darkness Sometimes I watch you go away I watch you go away... Hope you don't cry 'Cause in my own stories I'm ever side by side with you Somewhere to bind the distance Somekind of timeless moment Somewhen I'll let you know How far you've made me roam Across the nights, I hear a train That won't bring you back But I'll still wait... I never really lost you You never really left me I feel our hearts as one Every time I gaze At the moon  There’s no need to be as wise as Solomon To see that world has mired down We can’t see the end, can’t see the end We are accountable for our actions The way we choose determines our future Have you ever thought that it’s not right To live your life Without any sort of aspiration We’re not the ones that you will listen to But we just wanted to share our experience Nobody likes to suffer Then why do we make suffer others It’s not right to make your life go down the drain Perhaps it would be better to stop and think It would be better to stop and think Use your head Light the torch A lot of days are ahead and each of them is important Don’t waste your time it’s going fast Too many things went wrong Time is up Don’t be the one who doesn’t care Indifference is like abyss It will swallow you So try to make the right choice Where is the Garden of Eden? We search for it We try to find We try to grow What do you think about it? Break! Broken hopes leave us uncertain We're walking quite a distant road To make this all come true To see the sun, to talk to God, But we discovered that Jacob's Ladder breaks! Erect the monumet to the ideals Maybe it will soothe you And maybe not However act firmly and don't stick to the rules Resemblance to the experience Seems to be non-erasable I do not understand Whose joke was that What are we to do now? Where is our fortune? This kind of perplexity Leaves us uncertain We'll not leave this place Until we find another one Another ladder Keep your eyes open, pals! Keep your hearts pure! Red beams pierce through the sky moving us away from what we have already reached The place we stand is way too far from where we want it to be What makes things take an unexpected turn? Man try to think Why don’t you just believe The good old days They ain’t no more The war has become visible It has touched upon the sore spots of you We will move ahead just like we did Just like we did before The good thing is The good thing is we have our heads screwed on right We’ve got some common sense But anyway we’re trying to bring everything back Things will never be the same Use the hints that sky gives you The war has become visible It has touched upon the sore spots of you We will move ahead just like we did Just like we did before Be honest with yourself Stop mourning for the past Pull yourself together And join us! A question has come to my mind Why do I keep asking myself? Where are you heading like a tumbleweed? Like a rock that falls down the cliff? You are wasting everything! I find it hard to believe but you’ll always have a chance to turn over a new leaf We’re stuck between our desires We’re taking hold of ourselves But maybe that’s not the key That’s simply another deadlock Another delusion We fucked up! What if we’re doomed? Whaaaaaaaaat? The outcome is close! It will show you the truth! I know that sucks to be kept in the dark! We’re taking hold of ourselves But maybe that’s not the key That’s simply another deadlock Another delusion We are free! We are free to choose and believe in what we want to believe And hope that we have one more endeavour! I’m full of resolve I have no strength to mortify my anger I cannot hold this hate inside Breaking down May damnation take them I am who I am They’re just scums! Oh! Should I calm down? Or maybe I should just leave them alone? Or watch them fall into the arms of decay? They’ll have it coming! I’m sure that they should not exist For heaven’s sake make them disappear Burn in hell! Who will restore the balance? Is it early days yet for people to live in harmony and without torments? They say future is in our hands But why do we feel so helpless then? Things are waiting for actions from our side We have to hold our own I wish we could do more But future is in mist Future is in mist We forge our strength with our own hands We gotta stick together And move towards the mist We hope that our number will grow Righteousness! I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see What’s happening to her mother To her mother I hope I’m wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts According to our deserts Accept it gracefully Too late to be afraid We’re are ready to sacrifice We are ready to give out lives to justice And we’ll do that as soon as she demands As soon as she demands (Max, what do you want for dinner? Justice!) We want justice right here Right now! Righteousness! I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see What’s happening to her mother To her mother I hope I’m wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts According to our deserts We’re sick of waiting Make haste We need you! It’s 9 a.m. You woke me up to meet a new day Side by side with you we stand Striving not to lose the count of days Not to get stuck in the ruts Side by side with you we stand Hardships persist Side by side with you we stand Side by side We will pull through that I’m with you for bad or worse Let’s keep these memories in mind to have something To be proud of Life is a competition And we wanna be on top The winds are getting up We get stronger everyday However we’re still so weak So far from the ideal Far from the truth It’s 10 p.m. Looks like our days have come to an end Side by side with you we stand Luckily we didn’t lose the count of days Didn’t get stuck in the ruts Side by side with you we stood I’m so glad that we went through that together So many false steps we’ve made But we may call our lives well-spent We’ve kept these memories in mind We have something To be proud of Life was a competition And we almost reached on top We almost reached the top I see these guys every time I walk out of my front door I leave my house to get some fresh air I walk, I see their faces full of arrogance They crawl, they look like serpents in the grass. Led by the fashion and false ideas they’re just showing off to piss me off To piss me off What in the world does that mean? Triangles on your shirts And all-seeing eyes What the fuck is wrong with you guys? I am the one who does not believe in this crap You can’t fill the emptiness with the emptiness It isn’t even worth trying I think I will repeat the previous verse again I see you guys every time I walk out of my front door I leave my house to get some fresh air I hope some day you will head off from the wrong way Just don’t forget about the things you truly love Let it be our last attempt to evoke a response from you You’re not a mirror You’re not a reflection So fuck the fashion Stick to what you truly love Don’t forget about the things I’ve said If you are born to be an eagle Why are you pretending to be a flying rat? Step over that Don’t be a victim You are an eagle Night brings patience And lucidity of mind Am I the only one who is awake? It seems to me that right now Things are even more real and clear To some extent I am filled with darkness With darkness I don’t need the sun to be my source of light Cause I’ve got it inside I don’t need the moon to be my company Cause I’ve got it inside I’ve locked the darkness in the lighthouse It’s all about keeping it inside and not letting it out This is what my life turns in I am filled with darkness and light I’m a lighthouse I don’t need the sun to be my source of light Cause I’ve got it inside I don’t need the moon to be my company Cause I’ve got it inside I give my light to those who are adrift and keep the darkness inside Cause I am A lighthouse I don’t need the sun to be my source of light Cause I’ve got it inside I don’t need the moon to be my company Cause I’ve got it inside  'When it's time to Party, We will Party Hard!'

There is more in this world, than meets the eye; Reality is what we choose to see and believe There's a million things you'd like to tell But, I think I've heard it all before And I know I'm wrong, I know it so well Never will I listen to you, nevermore There's a million things I'd like to say But you turn your back, refuse to hear So, I keep it inside and watch you walk away But, the vision and the words, will not disappear The feelings we've kept inside, and the tears we've denied Always remember it's bitter taste Remember it's token; remember the words Opened wide, eyes to see, Within, beyond and behind Faces never seen, My mind is expiring, beyond all limits Impulses and thoughts torn into meaningless words The darkest of demons are hidden behind the happiest faces I wear the mask of fear Impulses and thoughts torn into meaningless words stained on this paper, like the liquid of life from a slit wrist I have nothing to say, yet I desperately search searching for the shadows of mine yet undiscovered, hidden within Opened wide, eyes to see, Within, beyond and behind Faces never seen I have nothing to say, yet I desperately search searching for the shadows of mine yet undiscovered, hidden within Impulses and thoughts torn into meaningless words stained on this paper, like the liquid of life from a slit wrist In the depths I saw something beckoning me An ugly shape deep down in the sea In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind In the depths I mirror myself, twisted reflections It is not me, must be a wicked imagination In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea The shape turns it's head and speaks to me I am too many for my shadow on the wall Into the deepest of water we hand in hand fall Voices do surround, sadness is unbound We dive, tranquillity in death is found A shadow walks beside me, my liquid gemini As I weep, It laughs, above the silent sky And as I laugh, It kills me with every passing second, with every passing second...In the deepest of waters... I am too many for my shadow on the wall Into the deepest of waters we hand in hand fall Voices do surround, sadness is unbound We dive, tranquillity in death is found... In the depths I saw something beckoning me An ugly shape deep down in the sea In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea The shape turns its head and speaks to me I wanna ride on a shooting star Ride through cosmos so very far See the ground down there below The speed of light's our only foe A mighty milkyway crusade Nothing can make the feeling fade Floating skywards at the speed of light Oh, yeah what a beautiful flight!

This is where I stand This is who I am This is the way it had to be Arrows point in every direction Where to turn, seek to learn; Lies in the sand of time Closing my mind to remember But there is nothing to forget All I ever had is here, before me Open up the opened and collect This is the written word This is who I am This is the extension of the wish; Conviction will blossom, As failure laughs in my face I'll still be waiting for my turn Closing my mind to remember But there is nothing to forget All I ever had is here, before me Open up the opened and collect Closing my mind to remember But there is nothing to forget All I ever had is here, before me Open up the opened and collect Again and again I fall into your arms Your embrace; my only true home My sanctuary from the cold outside Your embrace; my only destiny Archangel, come spread your wings around me Give me air to breathe and tears to shed Archangel, come spread your wings around me Give me air to breathe and tears to shed Feed me lies of hope; words so bittersweet Save me from myself and the agony within Archangel, come spread your wings around me Cure my fever, heal my longing, everlasting For this world, was not created for you and me Naked, unprotected we have fallen, down  Turning the page, write to cease new ideas Thoughts - all duly recorded Maybe someday, all the rhymes, given time Would get justly rewarded So long ago, you don't even know how it started So there you go Stashing the sketches and drafts of what has become an Encyclopedia of all the things you've done Expect the media to bother when you're gone Hours and hours of sacrifice, no compromise Forced as if under orders Planning to take land sea and skies, but can't decide When to cross the borders Encyclopedia of all there is to know Encyclopedia - but what is there to show The piles just seem to grow Is this ambitions one man show There's only one man watching you, John Doe He's both on stage and in the front row Encyclopedia - your one and only friend Encyclopedia - will pay off in the end Turning around, the objective of the way you lived Hypothetical fortune, suddenly found You're at the gate - it's too late Psychological torture So long ago, since you should have put it all out there So now you go Leaving for us to discover the paths you have tread Encyclopedia - all written by his hand Encyclopedia - will we ever understand Now he will never know Swept away by the undertow The world is listening now, John Doe Come back and reap what you have sown I could have pushed you out that day That would have been the easy way Watch you fly down that hundred meter fall I wouldn't care at all Falling, falling, drowning Inhaling and you're screaming Screaming... Pleading don't go Mirages - as I hurt you in my mind As the memories unwind Mirages - as you led me to believe In things that only you conceive Why do you play that vicious game I ask myself most every day So high, that hundred meter fall I turn around and there you are Falling, falling, drowning Inhaling and I'm screaming Screaming... Pleading... Bleeding Victoria falls were much too real It's beauty false though now I see Please try to explain What was the aim, what was the gain No matter how I try to wash it off The stains remain (We are gathered here today To say our last farewells We fell so hard down that hundred meter fall Now - only stains of us remain) Mirages - as you twisted with my mind As you told me I was blind Mirages - well constructed to deceive The trusty and naive Mirages - as you offered no reprieve From the hell you had achieved Mirages - as I finally could see That there was nothing to conceive I can turn away and hold my breath a day But I can't escape the stench of the lie That's haunting my mind I won't be free even if I'm deaf, dumb and blind All those weary eyes with their wicked smiles They come to my dreams, they're watching us now They're after my head, they're after my life Why can't they stay dead? I confess to my sin, reaching deep within It comes straight from my heart, where should I start In revealing my thoughts, reaching deep within I'm just letting it out and letting you in Reaching within It was so long ago, or was it yesterday I can't seem to find a thread in my mind A needle that's sharp that will make me whole That's mending my soul It's hard for me to plead, for your empathy When hatred persists, whom can I persuade? To forgive and forget I threw the stone but I stand alone Dig in my head and you'll find what is on my mind Take it all out, I insist that it won't be missed Wake up the slumbering man, Give him time to adapt to your world, I just know he can Living alone Is not the way for me Words on the phone They fade and die as I put it down Feel like a stone Emotionless, hard and cold All on my own I just can't find the way So tell me I'm dreaming Please wake me up Pinch my arm as hard as you want 'Cause all of this madness Makes sense when you're here One & one is two, but not when two is one Tired and slow Time crawls by us now Distance's a foe Far, far too strong for my weary mind Opening the door The world lies endless, there below Don't know where to go I just can't find the way What good are numbers anyway They put perspective on the game But we're playing off the board Oh the rules do not apply I feel it, the energy Keeping contact intravenously Floating chemistry Protones, electrones, forming atoms, molecules Into complex lifeforms So in perspective of the game What good are numbers anyway When we're playing off the board Oh the rules do not apply Tears from the ceiling That's how I'm feeling Falling - forgiving Call of the living Tell me I'm dreaming Please wake me up Pinch my arm as hard as you want Tears from the ceiling Tell me I'm dreaming Water fulfilling Life - a new meaning So tell me I'm dreaming Please wake me up Pinch my arm as hard as you want 'Cause all of this madness Makes sense when you're here One & one is two, but not when two is one But if you count you lose the point So in perspective of the game What good are numbers anyway When we're playing off the board Oh the rules do not apply At the time I left land and sailed away Never knew I would end up a castaway Wind went hard and the sky had tears for me The sea was all that I saw, my enemy There are days that I wake up and strongly believe There are ways to escape, I myself might deceive In the bottles I've sent, I reached out for a hand But as sure as I'm here, they have never seen land Castaway, your clouds are in the way of light I am stumbling blind Castaway, your thoughts, remembered by the prints That I left behind I know, but it's so hard to show Myself a way, to a better day I know that I am destined to live A life in memory, companion to my misery I've seen ships passing by, but they've never seen me And for each day that pass without being free I will moulder within with nothing to win I will gamble my soul to pay any toll Isolation I face every day, every night What is real what is not, I keep losing my sight Who's to care who's to not, I just never might know For the son God forgot, maybe someday, I hope someday they'll show I used to love the snow Can I reach it now Beyond my dreams somehow Only the stars look the same How I'd love to know their names I know, but it's so hard to show Myself a way, to a better day I know that I am destined to live Trapped by the sea, living in your memory I sit in darkness cold and wait Searching in my mind My watch has stopped at half past eight And I can't recall a thing I won't accept this divided state Where two are trapped in one I'd ask them to communicate If I knew how (I am the one of your fears In your head, in your bed, in your dreams - or so it seems Am I too much I have no fears, have no tears And might I add, like I said; Am I too much) They're starting to interrogate, looking for a sign Trying to intimidate, "we know you were there that night" It seems it's getting far too late to find an easy out But how am I to indicate that it was eye (I am the one of your fears In your head, in your bed, in your dreams - or so it seems Am I too much I have no fears, have no tears And once again, little friend; Am I too much) I wake before the curtains fall, just in time to see His devastating work of art, acknowledged and signed by me And you... you just... just cry I... I, oh I got so much I wanna say Yeah, so many things I've kept away All the lying, all denying, all the little bricks in his game So clear to me, yet so obscured If anyone could help me out, if anyone just anyone But if anyone would find me out I couldn't bear, I wouldn't dare... So I play The time has come to contemplate My dearest parasite You take me to a state of hate Where reason just don't apply This secret curse can't be my fate Or something I've deserved My mind is set to liberate Itself from you I look into your eye, I let go of my pride I confess to the lie, I look straight into your ... I am the one, one in my head I have no fears, I have no tears I am the one, one in my head I have no fears, I have no tears I banged my head against the wall Ran around in circles Scratched my itchy skin until I bled Crossed my bloody fingers Kneeled down and prayed Oh father are you in heaven What is in my defense I've committed sins, all seven Is there time to make amends Eight nine ten eleven Escalating fast Could I have changed the past or present And for how long will it last It's like I'm being cursed I just can't quench this thirst But now I'm ready to burst You know, I was in here first I am the one, one in my head I have no fears, I have no tears I am the one, one that you dread I have no fears, I have no tears I open up my eye and I, I open as my eye I stare and let it read my mind, eye open as am I Scanning through that tangled maze I lose myself again Who am I whose eye defines the thoughts run through my head And soon I find there's no way out, my eye is my guide again Showing me around, these pathways so profound Shining like the sun, I pretend it's just for fun As he forces me to run again Asking would you like to be my friend Eye look into eye and I try to draw the line Fight that lie and hide my fright, keep it out of mind Far away I hear a voice that shouts and demands Syllables and letters forming words of command Closer now, then from inside, I think that I understand Showing you around, these pathways so profound Shining like the sun, I pretend it's just for fun As I force you with a gun - run, run Asking would you like to be my friend I look into your eye, I pretend it's all fine I keep living the lie, I look into your eye (This fragile surface may hold the weight of all that's locked inside But will it help you clean your slate, or do you just run and hide You can run...) This fragile surface white and blue if studied will reveal There's something in the depths below that I cannot conceal Through years and years of acting and the practice of my stare Has made it easy to escape if you didn't already know it was there This fragile mirror of the soul reflects both fake and real But before you see too much of me I'll turn or keep it sealed So I face the ground and hurry on, I run from how I feel To tell you 'bout my self-inflicted wounds that will never heal  Under the surface Behind these walls This is where I'm hiding Hiding from the world This armoured vessel This steel can is my home And I can't get out And no one can get in No more will you see me again And oh, I'll never see the light of day And I know I've been under so, under so long Hanging on to my only hope When I feel that I just can't cope I'm looking through my periscope In a shallow environment I've been taught to live But I always wondered what was in the deep Trapped in the indecision of which way to go Where it's safe and home or where no one has gone Oh, I don't know why I don't get along Got too much energy but I still belong To a world where all my questions are wrong And they won't ever understand me, so Hanging on to my only hope Still looking through my periscope I have a question I would like to ask To who's ever listening To myself Does everything that you give come back to you And if nothing's offered you might as well be dead Oh no, I have a lot more to give But I don't Don't know how to let it out Let it show Not even to the people I know So here I go Her I go Hanging on to my only hope I'm looking through my periscope Pointing fingers mark the way the riches and success Those who couldn't make it won't be satisfied for less Fulfilling visions dreams where others failed that is our quest Trademark of a caring soul is to always know what's best Experience and innocence are currencies in trade Separate the stupid from the clever with a grade Ability and character determined at a glance Do you choose your fate or do you give in to circumstance Working hard for a cause we've never known That's not our own, but In the end We don't need directions To understand What we should embrace And what we should transcend When we pass it on ourselves Remember then It makes all the difference in the end Social climbers step on souls and hearts to reach the top They've been told to not look back or down 'cause then you'll drop Inflicting pain on anyone who's standing in their way Placing blame is easier than watching what you say Waking up to a world we've never known The curtain's down, the cover's blown Waking up to a world we've never known All sense's gone, but In the end We don't need injections To understand What we should embrace And what we should transcend When we pass it on ourselves Remember then It makes all the difference in the end And if you think you've had enough If you're thinking that has to stop If you're giving up Stop Looking up for a god we've never known They say he's there just say your prayer Looking up for a god we've never known We're all alone but In the end We don't need religion To understand What we should embrace And what we should transcend When we pass it on ourselves Remember then It makes all the difference in the end Take your time but hurry up Don't get tied but settle Find some time to socialize Solve the hidden riddle Well I've been told That no other one will understand Nor solve the hidden riddle Yes I've been told That no other one than the chosen son Will solve the hidden

me you'll all be gone The pain will go on Whatever doubts I'll prove So now the end is here I have no fear I lean my head on the ground I can not feel my legs and my arms are going numb But I still see the shapes gathered round Staring figures, features frozen Skins are pale and mouth are open Someone's leaning forward saying Try to breathe, soon help is coming Hold on Leave me here no need to bother Just look at me, I won't recover Don't forget to tell her that I love her Now let me down, I'm going under All the bitterness and hate is left behind It's a relief, it's a high I see my life pass by before my eyes And there's no reason to ask why High, high, high... I leave it all behind Hold on Leave me here no need to bother Just look at me, I won't recover Don't forget to tell her that I love her Now let me down, I'm going under Hallucination or for real, I start to feel Like I am floating in the air, I'm everywhere Colours shifting patterns intertwining Transparent angels singing Come with us come with us come with us come with us A tunnel rising ascending slowly White clouds form a path in limelight Come with us come with us come with us So here I stand at the stairs looking down I see myself on the ground I look into my eyes, they're telling me An inner peace has been found Electric shock, I'm back from yonder The pain is too, now even stronger Someone's leaning forward saying Welcome back son, how're you doing Hold on Leave me here no need to bother Just look at me, I won't recover Don't forget to tell her that I love her Now let me down, I'm going under Leave me now Let me down Now A stranger to the night I dwell in light, can not live without Those healing beams make me go on Peace is found inside In flood or tide, winter spring summer fall But when the sun is gone And I fail to be And this difference is a pain to bear Although a mystery I pray for it to end But there's no response And I fall again My moral breaks My limits I bend Till I hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Then I wake up from this wicked dream Till I hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Then I wake up from this wicked dream Eyes are opened wide I cannot hide, the fear I keep inside To all who rest assured enjoy My envy will unleash As my weary eyes shuts with fatigue The lights are out and here's my show I release myself From the cage that I now despise With the night I come In wrath I rise Cause I've been constrained But this shell that is left behind There's no sympathy My hate is blind, I hope you don't mind Till I hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Then I wake up from this wicked dream Till I hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Then I wake up from this wicked dream Bruised and battered I wander among you And I laugh and I smile as you're accustomed to But behind my wall that you don't seem to see I pray that someday I'll be all of me Should I defect from life itself Since it turned it's back on me Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know I'm buried deep inside and I won't let go In your darkness I will glow Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know I'm on the other side beckoning you to come Then I can run my show And I'll hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Don't you agree that we're one hell of a team Well I hurt you, I curse you I strike your head until I burst through I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream Then you wish it was just a dream My ambition from the start Was to rely upon my heart I would not follow Through every door you opened wide For me to sneak a peak inside I solely turned To the path of my demise Where you turned right I turned wrong If you got it made If you got all that you craved If you got away I'll tell you now you're all the same I'm falling without ties I am the one that truly failed I see you walking by each day With a frown that tells of your dismay I reek and stretch out My empty, lifeless, withered hand This did not turn out as I planned I too had dreams 'bout a time and 'bout a place Instead I live by your grace You all got it made You got all that you craved I guess you must have prayed All of you who not derailed For you I hide my eyes And yeah I realize I am the one that truly failed There's always time to tantalize Always room for analyze Of the misguided man Judge not the unfortune one It could have been your only son You rose high I tell low Reaching for the pennies you throw Humiliated I fawn For every time you make it Every time I'm mistaken And I know when I am gone No one will ever know My ambition from the start Was to rely upon my heart Now the beats are weakening My omission of the verity Made the search of false prosperity A lure of grandeur If you embark in my trail Preconvinced you'll prevail I'll bequeath no guidelines You're alone when you fail If you got it made If you got all that you craved If you got away I'll tell you now you're all the same I am the one who cries I'm falling without ties I am the one that truly failed You got all that you craved I guess you must have prayed All of you who not derailed For you I hide my eyes Yes I realize I am the one that truly failed Stone on stone Forming defenses from the crowd Brick by brick climbing the sky No asking where when or now Nor solving the mystery of why Supposed to lead us all as one The only thing they do is lead us on So just be careful where you tread Obstacles and traps ahead Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences Spotlights on the wall Guards assemble, fingers tremble As the sirens call But nothing's gonna stop us Till the inner circle falls Step by step advancing Closer to the core Megaphones that never cease Old slogans all heard before Shout freedom as a metaphor for peace Oh please The rising drawbridge's not so far We're run as catapults recharge It is no longer safe to hide See you on the other side Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences Spotlights on the wall Guards assemble, fingers tremble As the sirens call But nothing's gonna stop us Till the inner circle falls Oh I wanna be there Where the stones lie still around you Oh I wanna be there Where the fire will not harm you There's a place I always go when I'm feeling lost When I'm cold And when there's no shelter from the storm Iskenderun So I fall back into myself Stare at the pearl inside this shell And I have to go A world in the sun The darkness is gone Iskenderun And I'm all alone Under the sun Iskenderun Iskenderun Another Celtic Telamon Another Persian Salamis There is no guilt not innocence There is no us and them Jerusalem Oh I wanna be there Where the stones lie still around you Oh I wanna be there Where the fire will not harm you Look what they've done, look what they've done Everything's gone, everything's wrong So I have to go Nowhere to run Look what they've done Iskenderun And I'm all alone Under the sun Iskenderun Iskenderun Terrorists are walking around me And I walk among them War lords, Nazis, kamikazes When will they When will they stop Oh I wanna be there Where the stones lie still around you Oh I wanna be there Where the fire will not harm you Oh but the truth is This is a place Where I've never been And I've never seen Sacrifice paradise Ignorance, malice, ambition combined Second prize don't entice Indoctrinated we stand alongside Enterprise in disguise And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky Telling lies, alibis And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply This sleep here in front of me Six miles from side to side A caprice of geology Standing mountain high The wall whispers no apology Doesn't answer why The landscape changes radically As it's reaching for the sky And no one can pass by No matter how you try And if they let you in You can't come out again The flood will descend from here And everything will fall An arrogant decision Our destiny for all No serum intended here No antidote in mind All the species all the plants From the beginning of all time All gone away in the blink of an eye Sacrifice paradise Ignorance, malice, ambition combined Second prize don't entice Indoctrinated we stand alongside Enterprise in disguise And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky Telling lies, alibis And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply From the comfort of leather chairs Turn jungles into fields A segregated conference Outsiders forced to yield And those who cannot wield a pen Or haven't got a voice Are all labeled incompetent And they're all bereft of choice And no one will be spared There's vermin in the air And they don't even care This will reach everywhere The fire ignited here Will spread from coast to coast The center of attention Yet overlooked by most No island, no refuge made These ultraviolet waves Infiltrating everything And everyone inside All gone away in the blink of an eye  Deep in the soil Trembling silence Stones in the making Tension release Digging a hole Blood sweat and tears No rest and no sleep Then - I found a key Teeth shimmering silvery grin Mocking yet serene Gethsename staring indifferent Stunning beauty in green At once obsessed Obedient without parole Substract, withdraw A piece of the soul Deeper and deeper Searching for years for Something to open I could not see My science for god My modus operandi Of understanding Stood in the way This is the turning point The moment of truth Consider every piece of knowledge Gathered during this pursuit Confined, locked in Convinced there has to be more Browsing through all the schematics Looking for a door "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted." "The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite." What are the odds What's the statistic Is there a reason Or is it pure chance No treasure box Or safety deposit No secret doorway The lock was in me Teeth shimmer, reflecting the grin A familiar looking chin Six digit figures could never Buy the state I'm in At once I'm blessed Once splintered now become whole Increase, expand The reach of the soul I realize now that what we seek is not of an external nature But rather to fully grasp the full potential of ourselves We were born with the most sophisticated equipment known to us Yet we spend most of our lives searching for something else Something to come along and rid us of our boredom As if we were afraid to look into ourselves Afraid of what we might find Nothing scares me more than this fear Every generation lives In the shadows of the last This one's no exception Before traditions set the rules But this is something new There are no directions All or nothing We are stuffing Our waistlines increasing And with it IQs are dropping Keep on pushing Blame it on Cushing Sit down, take it easy you know There's no point in rushing Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season No work to be done So chill now everyone Hey, we're suffering from indulgence syndrome Nothing but joy We have no choice There's a theme park called the west With high fences all around So there'll be no distractions Here we do what we do best Exploiting everyone In search of perfection All or nothing We are suffering Taking their oil and their lives And there's still no cuffing No dominion No opinion There's not a new law or decision That we're not in on Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season We need all the gas To move that thriving ass Hey, we live in the immunity zone Time to rejoice Boys and toys In our corner of the world Got nothing much to fear So we turn on each other Some girls have formed a plan Goes straight past equality This without deception Injustice for ten thousand years Now blaming anyone Who can get an erection All or nothing They're not bluffing Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season Those who have none in crotch They've finally grown nuts Hey, we're standing in the enemy zone Let's head on home Y chromosome What am I waiting for What do I hope to find Lying here inside my mind So much scattered energy Falling in between Focusing on how I hurt Introvert I search my heart I search my soul A bust without console I search the ground I search for more I just can't find the door I can't decide I can't control I lost control I have no faith I have no goal I have nothing Nothing to explore Paralyzed from the neck up No twinkle in my eye And I have no devotion No chills down my spine Paralyzed but in slow motion Like a zombie I keep on moving round and round Making sure I can't be found Panic rising from inside Adrenaline set in Still I won't move an inch The world outside passes me by With the blinding speed of light Captured ghosts on retinas Fading out I never laugh I never feel It's hard to conceal I never hurt I never heal What is fake, what's for real I don't believe I believe I would've never believed I would never believe again I don't believe this Believe me I never would've believed You'd believe me if I told you how If I told you how I feel Paralyzed from the neck up No twinkle in my eye And I show no emotion No tears fall at goodbye Paralyzed like from some potion I'm gripped by this stunning notion A sensation so profound I cannot make a sound Apathy spreads fast through me Like gangrene dark and cold Life and death entangled Infection growing sore We all know the outcome From that struggle in the past So what am I waiting for Thoughts make up the pages The page contains the thought Burning for the winds of changes But that wind will feed the fire Ash to ash -

We choose to wage war. Just war, war, war. Total wars. Another world war. The relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other. The destructive power of war. I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this: the belief that peace is desireable is rarely enough to achieve it. We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. Ther will be times when nations, acting individually or in concert, will find the use of force not only necessary, but morally justified. The waging of war. The prospect of war. The conduct of war. So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace. War is sometimes necessary. Let me make one final point about the use of force. Yes there will be engagement, yes there will be diplomacy, but there must be consequences - when those things fail. We choose to wage war. Thank you very much."

That is the point that I'm making, and in the case of Baroness Ashton: she has never been elected to public office in her entire life. She takes an enormously powerful job, and the peoples of Europe, of Britain, of everywhere else - do not have the power to hold her to account and to remove her. And that fundamentally is what is wrong with this whole European Union, It's all about bureaucracy versus democracy. Things have gone horribly, horribly wrong.

Thought I was supposed to ask When I could not understand I didn't know some questions Were frowned upon or banned So when I first saw the shadow I trembled and I shook I grabbed your hand and pointed But you didn't even look My son you see shadows Embarrasement and shame But the sun makes the shadows The trees are not to blame I recall the sunshine And the look in your eyes As we reached for the sky In another time But at night in the dark I just couldn't see Couldn't see And the pain and the fear Came haunting me Haunting me There's something under my bed, oh Don't tell me it's all in my head, no I can't make it out in the darkness But the contours look like a monster Daddy why can't you stand upright Mommy why do you just cry Go back to sleep Go back to sleep So I never asked again But I didn't understand What was the point to have me If they couldn't find the time So I swallowed the shadow And made it part of me I thought that'd make them happy But that was not to be My son you're a shadow Embarrasment and shame Our son is in shadow You're standing in the way I recall the sunshine And the look in your eyes As we reached for the sky In another time But at night in the dark I couldn't see Just couldn't see And the pain and the fear Came haunting me Haunting me There's something under my bed, oh Don't tell me it's all in my head, no I can't make it out in the darkness But the contours look like a monster Daddy why do you stare through me Mommy why do you just cry Go back to sleep Go back to sleep The needle points at you and me Shining in the light But I can see a trace of blood On the good doctor's hand Epileptic seizure For no apparent reason Anaphylactic shock You think they're gonna cover this one up Stuffed up on the media altar The beast still lokks alive All hail the New World Order All bow in fear and awe And their eyes cannot see And their ears do not hear And they say it cannot be Is there something wrong with me The Galileos of today Freak accidents and suicides The scientific community Is now hijacked and used for greed Astra Zeneca, Glaxo Smith Kline A simplified spelling needed And it would read Frankenstein Isn't that Witty Take up the Rich Man's burden The savage wars of peace Now fill the mouth with venom And bid the sickness cease And their eyes cannot see And their ears do not hear And they say it cannot be Is there something wrong And even if those pulling the trigger All but openly admit Their anonymous committee advisors All stand to profit And even if you could turn some heads 'round To see the smoking gun Cannot do anything about it It cannot be undone Cannot drain the veins of our children In hope the poison spout Cannot slap the cheek of autism And ask it to snap out And their eyes cannot see And their ears do not hear And they say it cannot be Is there something wrong with me  Beyond desertic fields of ice Monstrous winds claim for their homeland Defied, everything that stands still Is hit by the cold in their hearts Sung is this desolating Victory, by the dead trees and the Troubling choirs of tortured wind Enchanting melodies of the Dark Beyond the magnanimity Of white snow's claimed purple gardens One grand crystal palace was built Symbol of the ruling of death Hidden in a crystalline room Stands the only living flower Trapped in a magic box of the Only ice beholder of a spark Lost once more, I don't know where to go Lost the sacred memory I forgot, where am I from? One broken branch from the grapevine Lost my only heart's bed No where can he rest all peacefully laid Another lost wanderer was born How could I lose myself so easily? Behold the magic From Gaia's darkest child's Relentless lips Kissing all your sins Seduced, I finally Stood still against the wind My heart was not cold My heart was no more In the realm of Forever-Night, My one and, one and only, my only heart is lost The only thing for me to do is to Free the last flower from its wicked prison It has the power to unveil the truth and the honor But this Forever-Night will last until Aeon's dawn Beyond snow's invaded lands An infant hides and stares at the sky Covered by the dying clouds Of greyness and of emptiness Beyond the Forever-Night An infant deprived from her heart Gets up and begins his last walk She's heading for the crystal palace ...where her last hope still lives Just a walk, the one, one last hope stands Forgetting all the rules, refusing to conform I'm a prey in the grey Oh why should I obey? You're lost, in the deep disarray One last try to one day scream victory... VICTORY! One more lost soul Now left with no colors A dead flower Who never saw summer Where art thou hidden colors? Thou mystic shades of life Can a dream still breathe after dying so many times? Nothing left to give All yet to be born Dying rules from Earth For the rise of my dreams Seeking the Moonlight Teachings from the sea Listen to thy heart And claim thy glory, and sing this song One fantastic Quest for a new paradise One day, no more I could give To this world, like an empty bottle Tearing my heart for this song Is just not a routine One day, no more I could feel For this world, when the last hope shall die The final countdown has begun But how long will it last? For the love and for the passion beyond the skin For the burning desire to unveil the mystery From all the pain left with only a stain Could only be cleaned by the truest lover's kiss One last dream to share One more soul to harvest One more try to One day scream victory Breathing honesty Bring me close to thee Dying rules from Earth For the rise of my dreams I am not from a gutter Even though it feels like it I do not wish to murder So why should I sing about it? Dragons no more ride their wings And I'm not the one lie Satellite-illusions of stars shining Makes me want to cry What's the true meaning of Pleasures and Satisfaction? What's the true feeling of total liberation? Is a body deserted when it feels no more pain? Is the heart useless when it no more longs to cry? Oh can the garden of purple gloom totally be conquered? Or will there forever be a flower somewhere living even if in ice? I still forever remember the first time I heard delightful sounds of hope and the fire burning the rope I could not hide my tears away from this divine beauty it feels like I had never lost my heart at all Waves of passionate tenderness Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder Mystical garden growing in the Dark I still forever remember the feeling I had of a new world revealing and its dawning dream I discovered a very long lost child who opened his eyes and was inspired by the Moonlight Waves of passionate tenderness Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder Mystical garden growing in the Dark Take my hand I will never let you fall again Lay your head on my breast I need you to feel my beating heart Closely… in you… So many tears were shed Like rivers who cannot find rain So many frozen dreams Broken by the tortured wind But all this time it was there The misty sounds of the deep sea And now by the snow its melody echoes… oh oh Making its way to my ears Never will a snow flake Lay again in purple gardens Never will one living wonder Be all alone again Beyond this Forever-Night The dead grey fades away Beyond the night’s crisped sky The Moonlight gently smiles Closely… in me… Take my hand I will never let you fall again Lay your head on my breast I need you to feel my beating heart… Closely into your frail body So many mysteries Lies in the sea’s Cruel Beauties So many living wonders Sing their dreams to others Never will I doubt again The return of the rain Never will I feel again The fear of the Crystal pain Beyond her motherly hands Is where all the beauty stands Beyond her comforting breast My heart found a place to rest Oh what a night Dancing with the romantic breeze of spring Feels like I could fly with my wings My new purple wings Oh what a site Dandelions play with me in the park Feels like my eyes now hold a spark A new mystic spark Sing once again with me the melancholy And all the things we cannot see Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see Just how seldom is our wisdom Oh what a smile A child has when his daddy comes back from work The child doesn't see hes gone berserk There's too much work Oh what a scream A child makes when some monsters shakes its bed Their teeth are brown, their eyes are red And I think it sounds fun Sing once again with me the melancholy And all the things we cannot see Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see Just how seldom is our wisdom The romantic breeze inspires rainbow twirling petals To dance with me where the Moonlight shines Oh what a spell Changes city parks into magic realms? Lets not say who is the lovely witch Behind all of this Sing once again with me the melancholy And all the things we cannot see Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see Just how seldom is our wisdom Alright, tonight we will climb to the sky We will ride the stars tonight I flee And you fly We fly Tonight In the sky Tonight We'll ride the stars So far Waiting Midnight to ring A lullaby for this wonderful night, climbing the stars A melody that makes the big monsters sleepy Flying In new born spring We sing The hymn Of new born stars A melody playing with the feeling Of when Midnight Rings A magic kingdom Unveils to my wide eyes Revealing to me How to ride the stars Just hold on tight and Don't close your eyes You will soon see the Moonlight Night's only ray of light Stepped into a beginning tale Where it is Forever the Night Maybe I will live enough to tell A story from so far so close to the heart Rainbow petals twirling in the night A garden growing in the dark Responding choirs from the stars Magical voices heard about everywhere Hiding so softly, just for a moment Safely away, all alone to play Stepped into an enchanting tale Where the wind blows into its flute Where trees play harp so magically Into the woods of Forgotten-Lands A small tribe stands around a fire Accompanying the melody Accompanied by an unknown voice With strange instruments from another time and place Hiding so softly, just for a moment Safely away, all alone to play Far away, around the fire Tribal Dreams, humble fantasies Suddenly, The Moonlight shines to me It reaches me, into my humble bedroom Suddenly, I feel that I could flee Magically, It seems that I can see All the eyes, from forests that never dies Suddenly, The tears fall into me Through the trees, on the ground Lies the light sought for so long Through the branches and the caves Sings a voice with unknown words Suddenly, Seems a voice into me Sings to me, in unspoken tongues Magically, Her words I can now see Telling me, Soon you will see the sea Fly the sky, and ride the stars Telling me, She is Eternity Suddenly, She opened all my ears And I heard such wonders I have heard, Enchanting melodies From the roses and from the thunder This is all, That I can make of it This is all that I can make of it An infant stares at the sky Covered by the Starlights Amazement fills his sparkly eyes An infant learns to smile again Covered by the gentle Moonlight All of his sorrows were not in vain ...feeling so safely naked Finally the clouds are exploding Down down the rain is pouring Hearing new colored birds sing And fantasies breathing Landed in a dream of deep enchantments Overwhelmed by new warmth into my chest Feelings of pleasure running into my body I open my eyes and forever let go An infant bathes in the light Covered by Moon's serenity Feeling that with his wings, to fly, he might ...a universe where... Wilderness is full of wisdom And where the wisdom is wild Where Angels are better seductress Then Gaia's darker child's ...now that my garden richly grows Why would I need to harvest autumn's flowers...  De forvildes rundt i den dybe stilhed Som tågen bringer Dråber af regn falder På deres forpinte ansigter De dødelige der vovede sig ind I tågernes skov i skumringstimen Fra deres munde Ligegyldighedens råb om hjælp For vi er i sandhed Tågefolket De vandrende Og for jer fortabte Der søgte fortiden gaver Der er ingen udvej Tiden er inde til at gøre Hvad vi i fordums tider Ikke fik gjort Med sværd i hånd vil vi hærge Hvad lyset dengang fordærvede Vi Danere vil med mod og had Nedkæmpe præsten Der tilbeder sine egne falske løgne Bed tral bed Dine ord bliver ikke hørt Du kvæles i din bøn Der bliver til blod i din egen mund Når vore sværd hugger dybt Jeres tempel brander I skriger om frelse Om i end fortryder Det er for sent I skal dø Nogle vil søge ly ved vores fod Men vi vil se deres falskhed Og ingen gud vil redde dem fra vores klinger KRISTENDRAB Indkanten af en forhekset skov Står en mindesten mægtig Dens ord fortæller om et blodigt slag Mellem østersø og vesterhav Arngrims tolv sønner i bersærkerraseri Hjalmar bød til holmgang Arngrim gav til sønnen sin sværdet tyrfing smedet af dværge Elleve brødre stod klar og slaget begyndte Elleve brødre fældes Hjalmar og tyrfings bærer Bliver hinandens banemænd Kun hjalmars våbenbroder Levede til at rejse denne sten Tågen er tæt en nat da mørket sig sænker Uklare skygger bryder frem Et bål brander i det fjerne De uvidende sikker omkring Deres våben ubrugelige mod natens kræfter For i natten findes frygten Frygten mod alt mørkt og ondt Men vi er de skygger som andre frygter De skygger der hjemsøger natten Vi frygten i andres sind Vi er mørket og tågen hvori de sidder Vi er kulden hvori de fryser En lysning i skovens åbning Hvad er derinde Kun den frygt du tager med dig Men du kristenmand, du har den evige frygt For os sande mørke ånder Du vil falde med dit folk For evigt Frostvind blæste og vinter stod høj Da den mørke hær samledes I dyb skov de planlagde Sejren over lysets udvalgte De kom fra nord Som brandingen ved flod Og skabte i mørke tågen over land De vrimlede gennem skov og sne Og mørklagde byer Overalt brændte lysets fæstninger De af lysets hær der ikke døde Prøvede at flygte i ly af natten De blev brændt af faklerne Vi bar med os på natfærd Den nat Dengang frostvind blæste Sejrede vi over lyset Men kampen er endnu ikke forbi  Vi er stormen fra nord, raser over land Blodet fryser til is i dine årer Alt håb du ejer visner bort, alt håb om liv for dig blegner... Fæst ej dit blik på os Mareridt og frygtindgydende billeder Er alt du får at se Af krige forlængst vundet, og nedslagtede fjender Fior sandhedens time er kommet Og kun ham med rent hjerte og klart syn vil bestå Så sku mod horisonten og vær vidne til din egen undergang Du underskrev din egen dødsdom Da du knælede og modtog velsignelse fra løgneren i kjolen. Danens rige Danens liv Alt blev taget fra os For hver af vore frænders død Skal dræbes ti af jer Kom så, landsmænd! Grib jeres våben, landeplagen skal borg. Ingen nåde viser vi jer usle krub Forblændet fra barnsben til evig underkastelse I tror blindt på korsets ord Fortæller selv løgnene videre Kraven er blot et tegn på løkken om jeres hals Jeres svig mod Danmark går ikke ustraffet hen I hænges i træerne langs landevejen Så alle kan se jeres rådnende lig. Med våben i hånd trænger vi ind i løgnens hus Bygget på vor landsmænds lig Slår din kjoleklædte krop til blods Og vælter dig af højsædet Dine blinde efterfølgere jamrer hjælpeløst over dit fald. En ny ære er begyndt Rejser sig mægtigt fra tusind års støv I der knæler i ynk Skal slås voldsomt tilbage I der knæler i ynk I lever på talte dage Omvæltningen er på vej, ofrene blir mange Kristent blod vil atter flyde Nu vil du ikke blive skånet For sandhedens time er kommet Frostvind blæste og vinter stod høj Da den mørke hær samledes I dyb skov vi planlagde Sejren over lysets udvalgte De kom fra nord, som brændingen ved flod Og svøbte i mørke, tagen over land De vrimlede gennem skov og sne Og mørklagde byer, overalt brændte lysets fæstninger. De af lysets hær der ikke døde Prøvede at flygte i ly af natten De blev brændt af faklerne, vi bar med os på natfærd. Den nat.. Dengang frostvind blæste sejrede vi over lyset Men kampen er endnu ikke forbi...  Kujoner... gemmer jer bag et kors Norden ægte folk undertrykkes og plyndres til jeres rigdom og glæde Men lidt ved I at nordens styrker samles til den store krig Jeres skæbne bliver grum når I alle ligger lig I en stinkende pøl i selv har gravet Når vi trækker våben venter ingen skånsel Kolde nordiske stål finder kristent kød Lysets udvalgte møder deres skæbne Hævnen kommer som lyn fra klar himmel I står til regnskab mod sværdets skarpe od Straffes skal I for tusind års udåd Krigen er nu begyndt Vrede krigsråb drukner jeres jamrende smertensskrig Ikoner brander, kirker styrter Jehovahs rige bringes til ende Norden styrker samles Krigen er nu begyndt Det hvidkalkede trosmonument står "sikkert" på bakken Og varsler fred for det kristne folk Bag dem en blodig sti af myrdede kroppe Vort nordiske folk slagtet med kristen klinge Snart vil det brænde og falde i grus ved hånden af Nordens Stolte Krigere 3 skikkelser nærmer sig i mørket Hadets flammer skinner i deres øjne Hadet over en stolt fortid taget fra dem Af kristendommens løgnagtige forkæmpere brander i deres blod Fyrtøj fanges og nattens stilhed brydes af flammehav på bakken Flammernes hævn fra forgagen tid kan nu ses fra fjernt Klokken kimer af varmen fra ilden og tårnet falder og knuses Endnu en kirke jævnet med jorden, endnu et skridt mod vor sejr Sneen fyger og vinteren raser. Nordens skove står frosne som majestætiske fæstninger For utallige væsner skjult for mennesker af nattens dunkle mørke Jehovahs usle fåreflok aner ikke hvilke trusler den venter i tusmørket Kampen er evig som ånden selv Lever stærkt i hvert Nordisk hjerte fyldt med Nordens mægtige arv Når lynet møder granen der kløves, når sky går for måne og mørket vokser Da vil alle de som troskab svoret har, til naturen krafter og Nordens lov Løfte blikket mod fjenden og skille forrædere fra frander Norden Stolte Krigere - Vi følger kaldet fra vort blod Kristen magt vi styrter med vrede, stål og mod Aldrig vil vi bukke hovedet og opgive kampen For evigt med sværdet ved siden Står vi beredte i horisonten og husker på vort løfte Om troskab til Nordens lov For evigt skal den bevares  I skovbrynet et dødskoldt lig På frossen jord lå Kampens ar hans ansigt viste Én ud af tre var han Én der ikke nåede stammernes ly Fangen og slagen af korsets mænd På hesteryg de red ham ned I hu de kom, da tre landsmænd Gennem porten brød Blandt lysets folk de spredte død Skrigene fra den kristne lød Da øksen fandt hans præstekød Pestens mand var faldet Dræbt af nordens mænd. Alarmeret af lysets tjenere, mænd uden ære Guldbetalt med trukne sværd sig nærmede Drev krigerne på flugt En ærefuld flugt tog krigerne af norden I undertal var de dersøgte af skovel til Flere skæbner endtes da bortfærd tog til Under pileregn og gennem susen af spyd På hesteryg blev præstens banemænd Indhentet med snilde, og kamp i skovbryn stod To krigere kom til skovs For våbenføre mænd at hente Nu suklle slaget stå, og kristenmands by brændes Luren blæser sørgmodige toner I denne aftenstund På strandbred er bygget et ligbål Landsbyens folk er samlet i ring Afsked skal tages med krigeren stor Brynje og sværd ved siden hans ligger Dækket af skjold er hans blodige bryst Landsbyens ældste beretter om ære Og krigerens mod bliver hyldet Bæger går rundt fra mund til mund På hans færd bliver der ønsket ham vel Til det ukendte går nu hans rejse Bålet sig nærmes med fakler tændt Men ligbrænding afbrydes brat Kirkens mænd i hurtigt ridt og Lansebærende lejesvende Slår fakkelbærere til jorden Og angriber sørgende landsbyfolk En niddingdåd udføres og liget tages bort Bålet forbliver utændt Forpeste hans dødsfærd kristen hun vil Og begraves skal han nu i hellig jord Med kjoleklædt fjols der bønnevers messer En niddingdåd er udført men glemmes ej Og kampføre mænd rider straks med bud I døden skal sendes de kristne svin Så Norden atter vort rige kan forblive Til skovs i hastigt løb, af glemte stier Mellem birk og gran, over klippe og vold Sølverpil skal bringes rundt Tegn til samling, til færd mod korset Hovedjagt går nu ind, på ragede isser På pæle de sættes til advarsel Niddingbålets flammer fodres skal Med lysets tjenere og løsgnens forkyndere Til kamp mod lyset I spredte styrker Ingen mulig udvej Uden hæder og blod Våben samles og flodskibe mønstres Alle som en, møder op for at kæmpe Hjemegns rygte skal kendes Som præsteløs og stolt af æt Sølverpilens kald vidner om samling til kamp Stål skal hvasses og brynjer gøres For nu skal fremtiden bestemmes Og herredrømmet fornys Hvor den udspringer, ved ingen De fornægtede løgne i stadig forkynder Styrker den, får den til at vokse Det mørke had i mig vokser Og jeg bliver stærk i min kamp Jeg ved at jeg må dø For at blive evigt kæmpnede Hadets sorte flamme Brænder i mit sind og styrker mig Til at bringe forfald Over de der har spottet Stoltheden og æren Et lyn slog ned og regnen tog til Klinger skarpe drogs Et tordenbrag lød, da stålet første gang mødtes Blot med viljen denne kamp kan vindes Sindet er våbnet Modet er skjoldet Blodet er styrken Kun en må på denne slagmark stå tilbage. Sejrherren ærefuldt vil, En stenhøj rejse over liggende lig. Og mandebod til fjendes frænder betale Splintres gør skjold i takt med hvælvet af glimt Sendt fra Mjølner med bifaldt om kamplykke. Valplads tør fra gammel tid nu længes At vædes med blodet fra den faldne Sværd glimtede blindt i månelys Og banehug blev fældet Et tordenbrag lød, da stålet sidste gang mødtes Valplads' agtelse er nu steget med et liv. Sænket er faldgitre, og forstærket er porten. Bueskytter på brystværn, bereder sig på angreb fra skoven. Byens selvudråbte herre ryster og bæver. Frygter sin selvforskyldte skæbne. Rigdom og titler tilsidesættes for styrke og mod. Grådighed og magtsyge, førte til forræderi. Blodhævn venter, for frænder sendt i døden. Belejringen er sat. Beredte er vi på talstærkt angreb Blæser i krigshorn og brøler råb på sejr. Vækker panik i jeres kristne hjerter. Bjælke i flammer føres af hævntørstige krigere Porten splintres ved første slag. Myldrer ind gennem byport i brand Lejesoldater af lyset falder i stort tal For nordisk had. Slettes skal mindet, om svaghed og underkastelse Så byens kirke står i flammer. Hævnen er nu taget og forrædere ligger kolde Hævntogtet føres videre, for slettes skal mindet. Når dagen er til ende Og mørket bryder frem Når natten rejser sig mægtigt Da vækkes mit had og ser din Ynkelige skikkelse Da vækkes mit had Tag dig i agt Hvor end dine øjne skuer Vil rædslen hærge dit blik Og fylde dit sind Hvor end dine skridt lyder Vil du være jaget Søg ej ud i natten på egen hånd Søg ej ud i natten Tag dig i agt Vundet er slaget nu, og slagen er fjenden Kampen var hård og mange er faldne Krigerne er bænket i storsal ved langbord Sejrsgilde holdes i byen nu vor Mjødens sødme nydes, skaber mange sejrskvad Fårekød og maltbryg bæres ind af fagre møer Kristen plyndringssold fordeles efter indsats Hver mand får sit og drikker på rigdom og lykke Høvdinge og stormænd går nu til orde Ærer dem der ligger lig Med hædersord de mindes For brave at kæmpe Sten og høje rejses Fortæller om sejren over kristenmand I solnedgangen sidder en kriger Og sværger om hævn Over tabet på broder og frænde Blodhævn er hans færd for evigt  Et varsel om dod, Til kyst bliver drevet af
