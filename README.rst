Terminology and types of rhymes
-------------------------------

1. HAT - CAT
2. HAT - HALF
3. HAT - PACK

The first of those examples clearly rhymes by anyone's definition of "rhyme". The first sound of the syllable known as the "onset", differs. The vowel sound, known as the "nuclei", and the final consonant sound, known as the "coda", are the same.

The second example might not technically rhyme, but it can still be useful. The "onset", the "H" sound, and the "nuclei", the "AE" sound, are the same in both HAT and HALF. But they differ in their "coda".

The third example is even less of a proper rhyme, but again it can be useful. The only matching sound is the "nuclei", the "AE" sound.

Words with multiple syllables give us even more options.

What is more important: to find the fewest words that rhyme any number of syllables (STUPIFIED - DIGNIFIED), or to find the fewest words that rhyme the greatest number of onsets/nuclei/codas (STUPIFIED - SCOOBY DIED)?

1. STUPIFIED - SCOOBY DIED
1. STUPIFIED - GROOVY FINE
1. STUPIFIED - DIGNIFIED
1. STUPIFIED - PRIDE

Perfect rhymes
DOG     -> [ [ [FOG COG HOG ...] ] ]

Onset rhymes
DOG     -> [ [ [DOLL DAWN ...] ] ]

Nuclei rhymes
DOG     -> [ [ [BALL CAUGHT FOUGHT ...] ] ]

For multiple syllables, show rhymes for each possible partitioning of syllables.
Order by rhymes that use the fewest number of words.
BEEHIVE -> [ [ [REVIVE DEPRIVE] ]
             [ [SEE WE BE ...] [THRIVE DIVE ...] ] ]

For multi-syllable words, remove restriction to rhyme on every syllable.
Order by words matching greatest number of syllables.
BEEHIVE -> [ [ [REVIVE DEPRIVE ALIVE] ]
             [ [SEE WE BE ... ] [THRIVE DIVE ...] ] ]

Syllables
---------
Typical model

In the typical theory[citation needed] of syllable structure, the general structure of a syllable (σ) consists of three segments. These segments are grouped into two components:

Onset (ω)
    a consonant or consonant cluster, obligatory in some languages, optional or even restricted in others
Rime (ρ)
    right branch, contrasts with onset, splits into nucleus and coda

    Nucleus (ν)
        a vowel or syllabic consonant, obligatory in most languages
    Coda (κ)
        consonant, optional in some languages, highly restricted or prohibited in others

Rules
~~~~~

Also, for "ellipsis", /ps/ is not a legal internal coda in English. The /s/ can only occur as an appendix, e.g. the plural -s at the end of a word. So it should be e.lip.sis

Nasal
-----

Air flow goes through nose.

Examples: "n" in "nose", "m" in "may", "ŋ" in "funk".

"ŋ" is known as the letter "eng" and the technical name of the consonant is the "voiced velar nasal"

"voiced" in the above sentence refers to whether or not your vocal chords are active. Your voice chord doesn't vibrate with voiceless consonants, like "sh" "th" "p" "f". In contrast, notice the vibration in phonemes like "m" "r" "z".
